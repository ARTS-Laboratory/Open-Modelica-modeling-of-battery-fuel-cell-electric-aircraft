v1 - Base Model.  Identical to Model B v1.
v2 - Updated annotation to work with ElectricalEnergyStorage library version 3.2.3 and PowerSystems library version 2.0.0 (note: causes library versioning issue)
v3 - Battery stack added in parallel with fuel cell using PSBatteryStack.mo, based on components from the ElectricalEnergyStorage library.  Within PSBatteryStack.mo, the 
component PSCellCalculator.mo is used.  Versioning issue still extant.
