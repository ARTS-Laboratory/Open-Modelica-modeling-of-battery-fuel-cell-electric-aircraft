Development files for cooling loops
Includes:
  1) A mock fuel cell block (mockFC); waste heat treated as a source term
  2) A simple HEX (simpleHEX)
  3) A small example loop to used to develop code (simpleCooling)
    --> Eventually, the code from mockFC will have to be moved to detailedFC in the main library
    --> Likewise, eventually the simpleHEX block will have to be moved to the main library
